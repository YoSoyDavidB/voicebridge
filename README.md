# VoiceBridge

Real-time Spanish-to-English voice interpreter for Microsoft Teams with voice cloning.

## 🎯 Project Status

**Version:** 1.0.0 (In Development)

**Target:** < 800ms end-to-end latency for real-time voice translation

## 🏗️ Architecture

VoiceBridge captures your microphone audio, translates Spanish to English in real-time, synthesizes the translation using a clone of your voice, and routes it to Microsoft Teams via a virtual audio device.

**Pipeline:**
```
Physical Mic → Audio Capture → VAD → STT (Deepgram) → Translation (GPT-4o-mini)
→ TTS (ElevenLabs) → Virtual Mic → Microsoft Teams
```

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Audio:** sounddevice, PortAudio
- **VAD:** Silero VAD
- **STT:** Deepgram (WebSocket streaming)
- **Translation:** GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI)
- **TTS:** ElevenLabs Turbo v2.5 (voice cloning)
- **Testing:** pytest with TDD methodology

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- API keys for:
  - Deepgram (Speech-to-Text)
  - OpenAI (Translation)
  - ElevenLabs (Text-to-Speech with voice cloning)
- Virtual audio device (optional for Teams integration):
  - Windows: VB-Audio Virtual Cable
  - macOS: BlackHole

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YoSoyDavidB/voicebridge.git
cd voicebridge

# Install development dependencies
make install-dev

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your API keys
nano .env
```

### Usage

**Option 1: Using the helper script (recommended)**
```bash
# Check your configuration
./voicebridge.sh check

# List available audio devices
./voicebridge.sh devices

# Run VoiceBridge
./voicebridge.sh

# Show help
./voicebridge.sh --help
```

**Option 2: Direct Python command**
```bash
# Check your configuration
python3 -m voicebridge check

# List available audio devices
python3 -m voicebridge devices

# Run VoiceBridge
python3 -m voicebridge

# Show help
python3 -m voicebridge --help
```

### Development

```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Run linter
make lint

# Run type checker
make typecheck

# Format code
make format

# Run all checks
make check
```

```

## 🧪 Testing

VoiceBridge follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology.

```bash
# Run unit tests only (fast, no API calls)
make test-unit

# Run integration tests (requires API keys in .env)
make test-integration

# Run performance benchmarks
make test-performance

# Run all tests
make test-all

# Generate coverage report
make coverage
```

## 📖 Documentation

- [Architecture Document](./VOICEBRIDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Complete system design
- [AI Agents Guide](./AGENTS.md) - Development workflow and agent roles

## 🔐 Security

- API keys are stored in `.env` (gitignored)
- Audio data is **never** persisted to disk
- All network connections use TLS/WSS encryption
- No telemetry or analytics
